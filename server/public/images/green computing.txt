welcome to my class
0:22
in this class we are going to talk about
0:25
green computing
0:27
basically how we can avoid negative
0:30
impact of computers
0:32
on our environment
0:35
green computing is the environmentally
0:37
responsible
0:38
and eco-friendly use of computers and
0:41
their resources in other words
0:44
it is the study and practice of
0:46
establishing the use of computers
0:49
and its resources in more efficient and
0:52
environment friendly and responsible way
0:57
in broader terms green computing
1:00
is also defined as the study of
1:03
designing manufacturing or engineering
1:07
using and disposing of computing devices
1:10
in a way that reduce their environmental
1:13
impact in simple words
1:17
when we design our products we must
1:19
design
1:20
in such a way it has no
1:23
negative impact on the environment
1:26
when we manufacture it or when we use it
1:29
or when we dispose of
1:30
computing devices it should not have any
1:34
negative impact on the environment
1:40
what is green computing a way of
1:42
designing
1:44
a way of producing a way of using
1:47
and way of discarding i.t products that
1:50
is sensitive to the
1:51
environment how we should design produce
1:55
use and discard i.t products so that the
1:58
environment does not get
1:59
polluted this is the basic crux of
2:02
green computing
2:07
in other words it is the environmentally
2:09
friendly use of computers
2:11
and their resources
2:17
what are the examples of green computing
2:20
some of the examples they include switch
2:23
of all devices that you are not using
2:28
purchasing computers or id products
2:32
from environmentally committed companies
2:36
participate in electronic recycling
2:39
programs
2:41
deploying virtual technologies for
2:44
example
2:45
we can have video conferencing instead
2:48
of traveling
2:49
are making use of papers
2:53
limiting printing recycling paper and
2:56
reducing
2:57
e-waste we must limit our printings
3:01
we must recycle paper and we must reduce
3:04
our electronic waste these are some of
3:07
the examples
3:08
of green computing
3:14
what are the three goals of green
3:16
computing
3:18
the goals of green computing are reduce
3:20
the use of
3:21
hazardous materials in the manufacturing
3:25
of computers
3:28
maximize energy efficiency during the
3:31
product's lifetime
3:34
and promote the recyclability or
3:36
biodegradability
3:37
of defunct products and factory waste
3:41
these are the three goals of green
3:44
computing
3:48
here you can see that number of i.t
3:50
related products are given to you
3:53
we have computers printers monitors
3:56
scanners keyboard and so on
4:00
computers have number of components
4:02
these components consume lot of
4:04
natural resources to manufacture
4:07
computers
4:08
we need raw materials to operate
4:11
computers
4:11
we need power to dispose of computers
4:15
at the end of useful life we need more
4:18
natural resources
4:19
to recycle them
4:23
so the green computing starts with the
4:26
designing of the product
4:28
with the manufacturing of the product
4:30
with the using of the product
4:31
and with the disposing of the product
4:36
green computing starts with the
4:38
designing manufacturing
4:39
using disposing of computers in such a
4:42
way
4:43
which has no impact or minimum impact on
4:46
the
4:46
environment
4:52
based on above four points we draw the
4:54
main objectives of green computing
4:56
as to reduce the use of hazardous
4:59
materials
5:01
second maximize energy efficiency
5:04
during the product lifetime and
5:08
promote the recyclability or
5:10
biodegradability of obsolete products
5:12
and factory waste
5:18
history of green computing the term
5:21
green computing came into existence
5:24
with the launch of energy star program
5:26
in 1992
5:29
energy star is a joint program of
5:32
environmental protection agency
5:34
and the department of energy of usa
5:39
it aims towards electricity saving and
5:42
less amount of heat generated by the
5:44
computers widespread use of computers
5:48
and related id products has a very bad
5:52
impact
5:53
very bad effect on the environment
5:59
the practice of using energy star symbol
6:02
include the
6:03
implementation of energy efficient
6:05
electronic components
6:06
such as cpus servers and peripherals
6:12
as well as reduced resource consumption
6:15
and proper disposal of electronic waste
6:19
the practice of using energy star it
6:21
requires that
6:22
we must implement energy efficient
6:26
policy second
6:29
we must reduce resource consumption and
6:32
the third one is
6:33
we must make proper arrangement for the
6:35
disposal of
6:36
electronic waste
6:41
a number of i.t companies and computer
6:44
manufacturers have taken
6:45
major initiative to turn towards green
6:48
computing
6:52
these include building computers with
6:54
more environmentally friendly materials
6:57
designing them to consume less energy
6:59
providing recycling programs
7:02
to dispose of old systems
7:06
what are the green computing best
7:08
practices are
7:11
government regulations however well
7:13
intentional is only part of an
7:16
overall green computing philosophy
7:19
the work habits of computer users and
7:22
business houses
7:23
need to be modified to minimize adverse
7:26
impact on the global
7:28
environment
7:31
some of the best practices related to
7:33
green computing are
7:34
as follows first develop a sustainable
7:38
green computing
7:39
plan in the plan we must encourage
7:43
iit community to consider and use
7:46
best green computing practices and
7:49
guidelines
7:52
the plan must have recommendations for
7:55
reduction of paper consumption
7:56
and paper uses
7:59
this plan must have recommendation for
8:02
new efficient equipment and recycling of
8:05
obsolete machines
8:09
this plan must have recommendation for
8:11
the use of cloud computing
8:13
so that multiple users share the same
8:15
computing resources
8:16
thus increasing the utilization by
8:19
making more efficient use of
8:20
hardware resources
8:30
second recycle dispose of e-waste
8:33
according to government rules and
8:35
regulations
8:38
discard unwanted electronic equipment in
8:42
an
8:42
environmentally responsible manner as
8:44
computer emit harmful
8:46
emissions manufacturer must offer safe
8:50
recycling options
8:52
when products become unusable
8:57
the third one is make environment sound
9:00
purchase decisions
9:03
purchase those computing devices the
9:06
designing
9:06
or production of which has less harmful
9:09
impact on
9:10
environment it means we must purchase
9:13
computing devices from only from those
9:16
companies
9:17
which takes care of the impact on the
9:20
environment
9:23
purchase those computing devices where
9:25
manufacture sports
9:26
the reduction of negative environmental
9:28
impact on product
9:30
and reducing packaging material
9:35
the fourth on reduced paper consumption
9:38
use emails and only electronic archives
9:43
no use of paper at any stage
9:48
use of track changes features in
9:50
electronic document
9:52
rather than making corrections on paper
9:59
while printing documents make sure to
10:01
use both sides of paper
10:03
and selectively print required pages
10:10
the fifth point is conserve energy
10:14
in order to conserve energy make use of
10:16
liquid crystal display
10:18
lcd monitors rather than cathode ray
10:20
tube
10:21
monitors crt monitors
10:27
sixth develop a thin client strategy the
10:32
thin
10:32
client strategy include the use of
10:34
notebook computers
10:36
rather than desktop computers whenever
10:38
possible
10:41
second power management feature to turn
10:43
off
10:44
hard drives cpu and monitor displays
10:47
after several minutes of inactivity
10:52
the third point power up and power down
10:55
laser printers
10:56
according to need
11:00
we must have web conferencing rather
11:02
than traveling
11:05
this is termed as develop a thin client
11:08
strategy
11:12
there are certain disadvantages and
11:14
challenges
11:15
of green computing
11:18
to have green computing it appears that
11:22
it can really be quite expensive
11:26
some green computers may be very low in
11:29
performance
11:31
moreover there are rapid technological
11:34
changes which are taking place
11:36
all these poses a big challenge for
11:39
adoption of
11:40
green computing
11:44
now what are the benefits of green
11:46
computing
11:47
the main benefits of green computing are
11:51
reduce environmental impact less
11:54
greenhouse gases emissions
11:57
less e-waste fewer resources needed for
12:01
manufacturing
12:01
new devices lower
12:05
energy cost
12:08
longer lasting computing devices
12:12
reduce health risk for recyclers
12:15
these are some of the major benefits of
12:18
green computing
12:23
how to achieve green computing
12:27
green computing is about reducing the
12:29
environmental footprints of computers
12:32
are of ict in general information
12:35
and communication technology in general
12:40
this is the most commonly achieved by
12:42
making data centers
12:44
and computing devices more energy
12:46
efficient
12:49
using more renewable energy sources
12:53
using less hazardous material in
12:55
computing devices
12:58
promoting device longevity
13:02
and making devices and other i.t
13:04
equipments
13:05
better recyclable all these proposition
13:08
will help us to achieve green computing
13:13
green computing summary thus green
13:16
computing aims to reduce the
13:18
unwanted and harmful effects of
13:20
computers on the
13:21
environment though the challenges are
13:24
many
13:25
but with ever increasing research in the
13:27
field of science and technology
13:29
we can overcome these hurdles
13:32
through the small steps that each one of
13:34
us takes towards
13:35
adopting green computing measures we can
13:38
make our environment
13:39
congenial for healthy growth
13:54
thank you very much
